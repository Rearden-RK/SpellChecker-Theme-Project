This Python script is designed to read a text file, tokenize its content into individual words, correct the spelling of each word using the TextBlob library, and then write the corrected text back to a file. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Importing Libraries: The script starts by importing the re module for regular expressions and the TextBlob class from the textblob library.
Defining Functions:

read_file(file_path): This function takes a file path as input, opens the file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding, reads its content, and returns the content as a string.
tokenize_text(text): This function uses a regular expression to find all words in the given text. It converts the text to lowercase and returns a list of words.
correct_spelling(word): This function takes a word as input, creates a TextBlob object from it, and returns the corrected spelling of the word as a string.

Main Function:
The main() function starts by prompting the user to enter the path to the text file.
It reads the content of the file using the read_file function.
The content is then tokenized into individual words using the tokenize_text function.
For each word in the list of words, if the word is longer than one character and consists only of alphabetic characters, the script attempts to correct its spelling using the correct_spelling function.
If the corrected word is different from the original word, the script replaces the original word with the corrected word in the text. This is done using the re.sub function, which replaces occurrences of the original word with the corrected word, ignoring case.
Finally, the corrected text is written to a new file named "corrected_text.txt" in the same directory as the script.
Execution: The script checks if it is being run as the main program. If so, it calls the main() function to execute the spell correction process.
This script demonstrates basic text processing and spelling correction using Python's re module for regular expressions and the TextBlob library for natural language processing tasks, including spelling correction 1
